  This is a reference architecture to run on your IIoT Edge Gateway with HiveMQ MQTT broker and Ignition Edge on a balena device.

  The application is reading from Modbus and OPC UA sensors using a variation of the MING stack (MQTT, InfluxDB, Ignition Edge and Grafana) to use the advantages of the Edge Computing to digitalize a factory. In this case, we are using Ignition Edge, HiveMQ and balena to add a UNS (Unified Name Space) for data modeling and MQTT Sparkplug B to format the data being sent over MQTT to Ignition in the cloud through HiveMQ cloud instance.

  ## Deploy the code

  Running this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application. You can do it in just one click by using the Deploy button in this page.

  ## Configure Ignition Edge

  Access to the Ignition UI using your local ip address with the 9088 port and install Ignition Edge. Create a username and password for Ignition and once the Ignition Edge is successfully installed, access to the Ignition Edge.

  To receive the data from the edge IIoT gateway with HiveMQ and balena you will need to install the MQTT module packages on Ignition Edge made by Cirrus Link. For this project we will only need to install the MQTT engine and the MQTT Transmission modules. Download the [MQTT Cirrus Link modules](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/third-party-modules/8.1.27) for Ignition here.

  When the MQTT Modules are successfully installed, you can go to the left menu on MQTT and create the servers (Engine and Transmission). Remember that the URL starts with tcp:// and add the port 1883 or your MQTT port from the edge machine MQTT broker.


  ## Configure the HiveMQ MQTT broker

  Check the HiveMQ MQTT broker variables that you can set them in the balenaCloud Device Variables tab for the device (or globally for the whole application) on the [README of the Github repository](https://github.com/mpous/hivemq4-ignition-balena#configure-the-hivemq-mqtt-broker). 
  None of them are mandatory and the MQTT broker in the edge might work without any variable defined.
